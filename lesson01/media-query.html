            <h2>Ether 12:27</h2>
            <p>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. 
                I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace 
                is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; 
                for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, 
                then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</p>

            <h2>3 Nephi 11:11</h2>
            <p>And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; 
                and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father 
                hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking 
                upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered 
                the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.</p>
